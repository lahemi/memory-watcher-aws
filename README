This setup does the following:


    - Installs, on the given servers, a small mostly awk scripts
      which gather information from /proc/meminfo.

    - Sets cron to run the scripts every minute.

    - Gathered information will be send to the provided S3 bucket
      or to cloudwatch as a metric or do both of these.



Getting started:


    - Obviously, the target servers need the AWS CLI tool installed.
      The provided awk scripts won't work outside of Linux, too.

    - Configure the setup to your liking in main.yml.
      If you are using root as the login user, you don't need
      the `become_user` stuff.

    - List your target hosts in the `hosts` file. You can use
      the "deploy script" for convenience when running Ansible.

    - You need to have a user with the AWS access keys set up.
      Better to follow the principle of least privilege,
      meaning, give conservative permissions only to S3
      and|or Cloudwatch and preferably do not allow logging
      in with the user.
